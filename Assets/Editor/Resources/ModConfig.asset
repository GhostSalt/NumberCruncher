  description: "Modules made by GS Electronics & Co.&trade; were slightly smaller
    in the year after their founding, compared to their modules afterwards. That's
    because there were no standards in place for the relative sizes and functions
    of bomb components, and you were just expected to know which modules would fit
    on what casing, et cetera. While this specific line of modules was discontinued
    after IBM (International Bomb Maintenance) set their standards, you can still
    occasionally find them on bombs to this day, but getting them to fit on modern
    bombs takes some artistic licence.\n\nFriggin' long flavour text. Really proud
    of how this turned out.\n\nGS Electronics & Co\u2122 were kind enough to provide
    us with Twitch Plays support. Fun!"
